<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>GLSA was established in 1989 by a group of Green Lake Elementary school parents, teachers, and members of Green lake United Methodist Church (GLUMC) as part of the outreach of the church in response to a need for quality child care which children could easily and safely access from school.  GLSA is a nonprofit organization administered by an Executive Director and a voluntary board which includes parents of the children in our care, members of GLUMC and members of the community.  Although we are part of the outreach of GLUMC no religious symbols or teachings are included in our programming or space.</p>

<h3>Our Space</h3>
<p>We are located in the large, stone, turreted Green Lake United Methodist church on the corner of 1st and 65th NE, across the street from Green Lake Elementary School.  GLSA enjoys a very large space in the lower level of the church that provides ample room for three classrooms, a snack area and an open space for gross motor movement activities we call the &quot;bigroom&quot;.</p>

<h3>Our Hours of Operation</h3>
<p>GLSA's morning program begins at 6:30am and ends at 8:55am when we bring the children to school.  Our afternoon schedule begins at 3:00pm when we pick up the children at school and we close at 6:00pm.  In the case of early dismissals the staff will pick up the children at the time they are dismissed from school. In addition GLSA will be open for full day care during school breaks.  Please see our calendar page for more information including our holiday closures.</p>

<h3>Our Schedule</h3>
<p>During the morning and afternoon programs we have a structured schedule within which children can choose how they would like to spend their time.  During the morning program children arrive at various times so we have snack/breakfast going on simultaneously with free-play and/ or teacher lead projects.  Before the children go to school they have the opportunity to get some exercise during 'big-room time'.</p>

<p>The afternoon program begins at 3:00 when we pick up the children from school.  We spend fifty minutes outside before coming in and having snack.  At that time children can have a snack or choose an activity in one of our three classrooms.  Each class room will have different teacher lead activities until cleanup time just before five o'clock.  From five until five thirty the children have quiet homework time during which they can receive help from a teacher or work independently.  Between five thirty and six we have what is called 'big-room time' which gives the children one more chance to run around and get some exercise before we close at six o'clock.</p>
