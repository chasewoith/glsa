<p>GLSA's staff are a group of professional, caring, dynamic individuals 
who bring diverse experience, perspective, and talent to their work with 
the children of GLSA. GLSA has an unusually low turn over and this 
continuity in staffing helps the children to build long term caring 
relationships with our staff. The staff use natural consequences to teach 
children to develop inner control, take responsibility for their own 
choices, and learn basic human values and problem solving skills.</p>

<p>GLSA's staff have back ground checks done upon hiring and periodically during their
employment. All full time and part time staff are required upon hiring to complete a 20-hour class 
covering training in child development, health, safety, and cultural & 
special needs sensitivity. After this training staff are required to take a 
minimum of 10 hours a year of continuing education as well as participate in 
periodic in-service trainings. In addition all staff keep current CPR/ 1st 
Aid certification for adults and children and take HIV/AIDS & blood borne pathogens training.</p>
