*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the process of collection of contracts using Contact Form 7 and WP E-Signature.*

1. [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7)

2. [WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7) (Ultimate, Business or Pro license)

3. [Stand Alone Document](https://www.approveme.com/downloads/stand-alone-documents/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7) (comes with above licenses)


*An Ultimate, Business or Pro license license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](https://www.approveme.com/email-limited-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7)


**Imagine trying to defend yourself in front a judge with nothing but a non-legally binding contract.  Your estranged client is claiming that they should not have to pay their invoice, even though you did all the work, and there is a document with their name on it.**


“Sorry.  There’s nothing I can do.  This contract is not valid.”

Something like this can **ruin your business**, even though you have done absolutely nothing wrong.

The E-Signing industry has a long set of strict rules and regulations that all documents must follow.  That goes for all invoices, contracts, and agreements that your business may use.

Instead of guessing whether or not your documents are valid, take the steps to guarantee that they are.


**The ApproveMe WP ESignature Plugin for Contact Form 7 turns your website into a court recognized legal document signing application.**

There’s no doubt that Contact Form 7 is a fantastic plugin.  It’s able to automate tasks on your site and make gathering user data quite simple.  However, it’s important to note that signing legally binding contracts is NOT what they specialize in.  That’s where we step in.

The ESignature Plugin for Contact Form 7 ensures that every single contract, form or invoice submitted through Contact Form 7 is 100% UETA/ESIGN compliant.

No more questioning whether or not your forms are legal.  Plus, you’ll never need to pay another third-party signing service ever again.

Our team has put a lot of time into building a system that follows all of the rules and regulations of the e-signing industry, not just in the United States, but all over the world.

You have the right to control your user experience.


**[Click Here to Try a Contact Form 7 Signature Demo](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7)**

**Most Signature Plugins & Add-Ons** only record the details of signatures and send them to your FTP server as image files.


These image files (of your client’s legal signature) are made EASILY accessible to FTP intruders.  Other E-sign plugins are not legally binding (and certainly not UETA/ESIGN compliant) because **they fail to address most of the industry’s laws and regulations.**

Any dispute over your contracts would not be in your favor.  If you or a client ever fell victim to fraud or identity theft, you would not have much to stand on.  Why risk it?

**Some of the Powerful Features of ApproveMe’s E-Sign Plugin for Contact Form 7:**

*UETA/ESIGN Compliance*

We keep our plugin 100% compliant with the most current e-signing laws.  Rest easy knowing that any form or document signed with this plugin will stand up in court.

*Unique Signer Downloads*

Secure your PDF downloads.  Only when the sender is logged in and when the signer uses their unique download invitation can a contract be downloaded.  


*Encrypted Data Storage*

Unlike other plugins, we never store data on easily accessible FTP servers.  We encrypt and store data in different strategic locations in your database.  Everything is fully secure.

In fact, if a hacker were to even attempt to unencrpyt you data, the entire file would destroy itself.  We invested heavily into the security of this plugin so that your documents will be completely safe.


*Instant Trigger Redirects*

Redirect your signers to their contracts immediately after filling out a form.  This will help move your clients down the funnel without forgetting any steps or getting confused by directions.  It will be much easier to get your contracts signed.


*Responsive Design*

Get your contracts signed from anywhere.  Our plugin works with all desktop and mobile browsers for both Android and iOS devices including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.

*Dynamic Form Fields*

Take sections on info from your forms and dynamically insert them into your contracts.  Now all of your contracts will be customized for your clients.


*Signing Reminder Emails*

Having trouble getting your client’s signature?  Set up automatic reminder emails to make sure they sign.  You choose the trigger date and frequency.  The plugin does the rest.

*Zero Monthly Fees Per User + Unlimited Users*

There are no limits to how many contracts you can create.  Everyone on your team can have access to the plugin.  We simply don’t believe in limits, or hidden fees.


**Secure your contracts and rest easy. [click here for a demo](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7)**

This plugin is amazing for Freelancers, Web Designers, Photographers and Small Business owners who want to simplify their contract generation process.

###Get started by following these steps to set up your Contact Form 7 Signature Plugin###


**Step 1:**
ApproveMe's WP E Signature requires a few more plugins/add-ons to help you release the full power and automate Contact Form 7 as well as Digital Signatures that are legally binding. The following plugins are required:

1. [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)
2. [WP E Signature](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7) (ultimate, business or pro license)
3. [E-Signature Business Pack](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7) (comes with your license above)
4. [Signature Add-On by ApproveMe](this plugin)

**Step 2:**
*Input your ApproveMe license*
After buying a business license from ApproveMe, you must input your new license key to launch upgrades and access technical support.
Log into your account to download your license key [ApproveMe account](https://www.approveme.com/purchase-history?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7) here (your password is included in the receipt emailed to you)

**Step 3:**
*Set up a blank WordPress page*
Once the WP eSignature plugins and add-ons have been installed and your configurations are saved, you must set up a blank WordPress webpage for every Stand Alone Document (or contract) you will be producing/sending to your form submitters.
Discover more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting this [helpful article](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/faq/basic-document-vs-stand-alone-document/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7)


**Step 4:**

*Set up a Stand Alone Document*
Using your new blank WordPress page, you will then need to produce a Stand Alone Document and then connect the WordPress page to our Stand Alone Document.
Find out more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting [documentation page](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article/stand-alone-documents-add-on/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7) for this add-on.


**Step 5:**
*(optional) Input Contact User Details into a Contract*

This step will change depending on what you want for the desired outcome.  Approve Me's Digital Signature is triggered once a Contact Form is submitted. You’ve got the power to incorporate Contact Form user info (which was inputted from the customer once the form was submitted) into a brand new custom contract form which will either be emailed to the customer or shown to the customer after they submit the form.


**How to use Contact Form 7 to add form fields details into a contract**

Go to the Signer Input Fields/Custom Fields symbol and choose "Contact Form Data".

Choose the Contact Form that you’ve already made (and want to link with your contract form) using the drop down option list.
 
Pick the field info you want to include in your new contract.

A shortcode is created using this data. Don’t worry — your customer will only see the real field value when signing your contract.
This is an example of the auto-generated shortcode which will get placed in the document you are producing when you select your desired field value from your Formdiable Form.


[esig formdiable formid="3" field_id="1" ]


You can easily transfer the shortcode to any place in your contract form.  It will show the customer’s provided info anywhere the shortcode is found.



**Step 6:**

*Select your document preferences and save settings*


Once you’ve inserted all the required contract text and linked your WP form fields to your Stand Alone Document, it’s time to choose your document settings.


Important note: Before you can post your contract form, you must link your Stand Alone Document to the blank WordPress webpage you made previously for your contract. Do this by looking for and choosing the webpage from the "Display on this page" drop down option list found under the "Document Options" area. 

We decided NOT to include this page in your nav menu since it will be connected to a Contact Form and will not work properly unless it has the field values of that submitted Contact Form.


**Step 7:**

*Almost there… (halfway done)*

Once you've published your Stand Alone Document, you’re halfway done. In the next step you have to pick your "trigger" and "action" selections for this document in Contact Form 7.


Select LET'S GO NOW! to establish those final Contact Form 7 preferences.




**Step 8:**

*Finalize creating the Formdiable Form workflow/trigger*

Almost there!  Now all you need to do is select your contract and your preferred actions once the workflow is activated.

Go to the "Forms" tab located in the WordPress control panel.

Select the form you attached to the Stand Alone Document.

Choose the "E-Signature" choice within the form options and specify the remaining options.

Now You're done!

== Screenshots ==

1. **Add New Document:** After installing the WP E-Signature, you will need to draft up a new “Stand Alone Document”



2. **Contact Form 7 Data** If you click the Signer Input Fields icon you will see the option “Contact Form 7 Data.” Click this to connect a WP Form to this contract.




3. **Select Your Contact Form:**  If you already have your Contact Form created you can easily insert dynamic field data (from the form that is being submitted/triggering this contract) by selecting the Contact Form.


4. **Choose Your Contact Form 7 Fields:** After selecting your Contact Form you will see the available field options from this particular Contact Form. You can easily insert dynamic data from your form anywhere in this new contract.



5. **Document Signing Options (optional):** The powerful WP eSignature tool by ApproveMe features plenty of customizable options including: Signing reminder Emails, Attach PDF to emails, Dropbox Sync, Auto Register WordPress Users, and TONS more. To read all about the available add-on features (which come with the business license) please see: [https://www.approveme.com/esign-integrations](https://www.approveme.com/esign-integrations/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7)


6. **Connect Your Document to a Page:**Once you’re satisfied with your contract, you will need to select a BLANK WordPress page to attach this document to. 

Important: Do NOT include this page in your Nav menu.  All of the magic actually happens after the Contact Form is submitted (there’s no need to link to this page because the user will either be emailed a custom link or they will be automatically redirected once the Contact Form is submitted).


7. **Click “LET’S GO NOW”:**After you have published your contract, you just need to connect your Stand Alone Document to your Contact Form. This is pretty straight forward. Just click the “LET’S GO NOW!” button to be redirected to the actions/trigger tab for your specific form.

8. **Define Your Signing Logic:** This is the page (inside of Contact Form 7) that needs to be customized. Please choose the Signer’s Full Name and the Signer’s Email address along with any other additional eSignature settings you’d like to include with your contract.


9. **User Submits a Contact Form 7** Once a user submits the Contact Form that you connected to your eSignature contract, they will either be immediately redirected to the contract or emailed an unique invitation to sign their contract.  All submitted details from Contact Form 7 will be included.


10. **Review & eSign:** With their e-signature, the customers agree to the terms of the document.


11. **Select a Digital Signature:**Signers can choose a typed or digital signature



12. **Agree & eSign:** With their e-signature, the customers agree to the terms of the document.


13. **View Signed Document Email:**Signers will be sent an email that includes the link to the document (and a PDF version of the contract if you opted for this method).



14. **Save as PDF:**Customers can either view, print or download their signed document from the website. To do this, they need to click “View Signed Document” in the email that was sent to them upon signing. (With the “Attach as PDF” add-on installed, you can also automatically include the signed contract as a PDF attachment in this email.)



15. **WordPress Audit Trail eSignature Certificate:**  Proving signer intent is a very important component to signing electronic documents. Every contract that is signed using WP E-Signature includes a detailed Signature Certificate. You can [read all about the security of this report here](https://www.approveme.com/wordpress-audit-trail-e-signature-certificate/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contactform7).
